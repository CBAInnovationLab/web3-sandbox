## Web3 Sandbox

This is a sandbox app that can be used to throw load at an instance of ethermint.
It assumes that you already have Node.JS, [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) and [Ethermint](https://github.com/tendermint/ethermint/blob/master/docker/Dockerfile#L6) installed.

### Running
1. `yarn install` to install node_modules
1. `npm run ethermint:init` to initialise a fresh chain
1. `npm run ethermint:start` to start ethermint
1. `npm start` to run the load generation app
1. Or `npm run contracts:deploy` to deploy a test contract
